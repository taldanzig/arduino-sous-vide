Arduino Sous-Vide
=================

We built a [sous-vide][sv] cooking device using an [Arduino Uno][uno],
a bread board, an [LM335][lm335] temperature sensor and a relay,
fondly named Franken-relay, due to its rather unsightly appearance.

Built by Tal Danzig and Shaun Jackman over a number of rainy
afternoons in 2012.
